  Receiver is nothing more than an opinionated micro framework implementation of the Observer pattern (~120 LOC).
  As a ReactiveSwift user myself, most of time, it's difficult to convince someone to just simply start using it. The reality, for better or worse, is that most projects/teams are not ready to adopt it:

The intrinsic problems of adding a big dependency.
The learning curve.
Adapting the current codebase to a FRP mindset/approach.
Nevertheless, a precious pattern can still be used, even without such an awesome lib like ReactiveSwift. ðŸ˜–
